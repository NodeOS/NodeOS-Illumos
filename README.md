# NodeOS for Illumos

Given how well node works on SmartOS, thanks to the Joyent team,
an Illumos based NodeOS seems like a natural fit.

## Features

- DTrace across the C++/JavaScript stack
- core dumps that resolve v8 objects
- Zones to truely isolate users and processes

## Current Status

Nothing yet, this is just the plan.
